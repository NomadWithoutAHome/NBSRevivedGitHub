            <p class="mb-3">
                "No Bullsh!t Simpsons" is your go-to destination for a hassle-free and mobile-friendly way to enjoy your favorite Simpsons episodes. Our journey began back in 2015 when we realized that finding a simple, ad-minimal, and browser-based platform to watch The Simpsons was harder than it should be.
